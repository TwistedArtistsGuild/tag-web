# Removed deploy step. This workflow now only runs CI checks (install, audit, lint, build, export, artifact upload).
# Azure App Service will handle deployment and startup using its own configuration.
# To enable auto-deployments, add a trigger on push or PR and remove the manual-only logic above.
# For approval workflows, use environments with required reviewers in your repo settings.
