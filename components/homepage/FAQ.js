		question: "What is the Twisted Artists Guild (TAG) and who does it serve?",
		answer: (
			<div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
				TAG is a dynamic B2B2C platform designed to bridge the gap between creative artists and appreciative art lovers. On one side, we empower independent artists and creative professionals by giving them a free, powerful space to showcase their portfolio, manage sales, and promote creative services and classes. On the other side, our art-loving public finds an aesthetic, easy-to-navigate marketplace to purchase unique art pieces, event tickets, merchandise, and exclusive classes. In short, TAG isn’t just an art gallery – it’s a full-service business manager that helps artists focus on creativity while we handle commerce, customer support, and reliable delivery.

		question: "How does TAG ensure top-tier customer support for its buyers?",
		answer: (
			<div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
				Our commitment to exceptional customer service underpins everything we do. For art buyers, TAG promises a hassle-free experience—from prompt shipping of art, tickets, and merchandise to proactive support if issues arise. Imagine having a live support system that intercepts last-minute inquiries (even those “Oops, when do doors open?” moments) and ensures you always get the information you need. And should any unforeseen circumstance occur (like an artist dealing with emergencies), we’re prepared with clear refund policies and resolution measures to keep you satisfied.

	{
		question: "What are TAG’s pricing and fee structures?",
		answer: (
			<div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
				For the most part, TAG is free for artists to set up their profiles and showcase their work. Our revenue model is based on a simple percentage fee on sales, helping us maintain and improve the platform while keeping access affordable. While there’s occasional discussion around introducing a nominal membership fee (projected at around $60 per year), our primary revenue remains a commission on successful transactions. This structure assures both artists and buyers that quality, transparency, and top-notch customer service remain our cornerstones.
