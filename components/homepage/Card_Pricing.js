        Minimal monthly or annual dues, plus a small transaction fee on sales that already includes card processing. We
        earn a percentage, so our job is to maximize your sales, not nickel and dime you.

        À la carte services at cost plus a minimal margin: shipping discounts, group health insurance, liability
        insurance, and more, so that together we have real collective bargaining power.
