**1. Introduction**

This policy outlines the dispute resolution process for addressing
disagreements within the guild, applicable to its Board, staff, artist
members, and the public. It is based on mediation, conflict resolution,
and best legal practices.

**2. Immediate Consequences for Egregious Actions**

Egregious actions will have immediate consequences as explicitly defined
in the Codes of Conduct (CoCs).

**3. Mediation Request**

Any individual associated with the Collective may request mediation
procedures for resolving personal, civil, or business-related
disagreements.

**4. Mediation and Conflict Resolution Approach**

-   Both parties involved in a dispute will be heard, potentially
    separately.

-   Witnesses may be consulted, and all relevant facts will be gathered.

-   Parties will be brought together, even asynchronously, to negotiate
    a mutually beneficial outcome.

-   The Collective\'s representatives will act as trauma-informed
    facilitators, encouraging empathy, learning from mistakes, and
    finding creative solutions.

**5. Rights of Complainants**

-   **Right to File a Complaint**: Any person may file a complaint
    against anyone associated with the Collective.

-   **Components of a Complaint**:

    -   Summary to share with the subject of the complaint.

    -   Internal notes with relevant details for the Collective's staff.

    -   Call to action and communication history.

    -   Privacy preferences.

    -   Uploads and referenced data.

    -   Criminal activity flag, if applicable.

    -   Urgent flag for immediate action requests.

**6. Anonymity Levels**

-   **Anonymous**: Requires authentication to prevent automated
    campaigns; highest scrutiny level.

-   **Protected**: Complainant is known to the Collective; identity
    hidden from the subject; medium scrutiny level.

-   **Known**: Complainant consents to being named; lowest scrutiny
    level.

**7. Substantiating a Complaint**

-   Complaints are initially measured against the CoC.

-   If the CoC is insufficient or an appeal is made, the dispute
    resolution process begins.

-   Urgent and credible complaints with sufficient information may
    prompt immediate investigations.

**8. Investigation and Negotiation**

-   A team of two will be assigned to substantiated cases.

-   For anonymous complaints, the advocate acts as the chief
    investigator.

-   One advocate will liaise with the complainant, the other with the
    subject.

-   Emotional responses are acceptable but may require revisions.

-   Advocates aim for a mutually beneficial outcome; if unsuccessful, a
    formal list of grievances is prepared for mediation.

**9. Mediation**

-   A meeting is scheduled with both parties, their advocates, and a
    neutral third party.

-   Parties may decline to participate but must authorize their advocate
    to negotiate.

-   The mediator recommends resolutions, which, if agreed upon, close
    the complaint.

**10. Resolution Options**

-   Parties are instructed not to contact each other, with violations
    leading to removal from the Collective.

-   Suggesting new CoC rules for Board review.

-   Issuing warnings with specific consequences, subject to Board
    certification.
