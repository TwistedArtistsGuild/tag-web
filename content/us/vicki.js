	bio: `Vicki grew up in a musical family, cultivating a deep love for all kinds of music—though she secretly dreams of belting out show tunes on a Broadway stage. Despite claiming she’s not an artist, she enjoys painting, even if she doesn’t do it often.
 
Professionally, Vicki is a passionate community mobilizer, dedicated to creating meaningful change and protecting communities from the harms of drug and alcohol use. As a harm reductionist, she champions all pathways to recovery, advocating for inclusive and compassionate approaches beyond just abstinence-based models.
 
She firmly believes in the deep connection between mental wellness and artistic expression, recognizing that creativity is a powerful force for healing. To her, everyone has a hidden artistic talent just waiting to be discovered.`,
