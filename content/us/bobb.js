	bio: `My Journey: From Heartbreak to Healing Through Art

After a challenging divorce, I found myself at a crossroads. My therapist suggested immersing myself in creative expression as a path to healing—a recommendation that eventually led me to build this guild. I’d once tried my hand at selling tie dye during my college years, a venture that encountered its fair share of challenges, including tax troubles and the headaches of navigating business paperwork. While that chapter didn’t end in success, it sparked a lifelong fascination with art in all its forms.

In my quest for reinvention, I reconnected with the pulsating energy of live music, meeting remarkable DJs and attending band performances. Inspired by those experiences, a few gifted mentors taught me the art of spinning. Even though I never saw myself as an “artist” in the traditional sense, I soon discovered that creativity was in my blood. Today, I proudly wear many hats: I’m a Drum and Bass DJ who spins energetic sets, and I channel my creativity through flow arts—wielding poi, swords, a dragon staff, rope dart, and martial staff as my expressive tools.

I continue to make tie dye, but instead of selling it, I joyfully create pieces to share with friends and family. My greatest passion, however, lies in teaching—sharing these art forms with anyone eager to learn. Though the demands of coding this website keep me busy, every artistic endeavor and interaction fuels my commitment to building a community where art and resilience thrive.

This guild is my answer to transformation—a celebration of second chances, the courage to embrace change, and the power of creative expression to heal and connect us all.`,
