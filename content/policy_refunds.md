# Refund Policy for B2B2C Art Platform

# Purpose and Scope:

This refund policy outlines the terms and conditions under which the
public (buyers), our guild (platform), and external third-party artist
members (sellers) interact regarding sales returns and refunds. The
policy aims to ensure a fair and transparent process that protects
buyers while allowing artists flexibility in their creative process.

**2. Buyer Assurance:**

-   Buyers are guaranteed to receive their purchased art within the
    agreed-upon timeframe. If the commitment cannot be met, they are
    entitled to a full refund.

-   Artists are encouraged to communicate any delays in the delivery
    process to the buyer and the guild promptly.

**3. Artist Flexibility:**

-   Artists may request an extension of the delivery deadline if they
    encounter unforeseen circumstances. This request must be
    communicated to both the buyer and the guild with a new estimated
    delivery date.

-   If the buyer agrees to the new timeline, the purchase agreement
    remains valid. If not, the buyer may opt for a refund.

**4. Refund Eligibility:**

-   Buyers are eligible for a refund if the artwork is not delivered
    within the original or mutually agreed extended timeframe.

-   Refunds will also be issued if the artwork delivered is
    significantly different from what was described in the listing.

**5. Refund Process:**

-   Buyers must initiate a refund request through the platform's
    customer service portal, providing details of the purchase and
    reasons for the refund.

-   The guild will review the request and liaise with the artist to
    resolve the issue within 14 business days.

**6. Artist Accountability:**

-   Artists are required to update their progress regularly through the
    platform's communication tools.

-   Failure to communicate progress or delays may result in penalties,
    including suspension from the platform.

**7. Dispute Resolution:**

-   In case of disputes, the guild will mediate between the buyer and
    the artist to reach an amicable solution.

-   Both parties are encouraged to provide evidence supporting their
    claims.

**8. Amendments:**

-   This policy may be updated periodically. All parties will be
    notified of substantial changes, and continued use of the platform
    will constitute acceptance of the revised terms.

**9. Contact Information:**\
For any questions or concerns regarding this refund policy, please
contact our support team at \[support email\] or \[support phone
number\].

This policy ensures that while buyers have the security of receiving
their art or a refund, artists are given the flexibility to manage their
creative process responsibly.
